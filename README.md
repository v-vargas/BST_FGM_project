Overview & Motivation: 

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 5.3 states that by 2030 they hope to eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage, and female genital mutilation (WHO). It is estimated that 200 million girls in the world today have experienced female genital mutilation (FGM) (UNFPA). FGM is defined as all procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons (WHO). The practice of FGM is a violation of human rights. Perpetuated by gender inequalities, FGM is harmful to the physical, emotional, and psychological health of girls and women.

FGM is commonly practiced in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia, with Somalia having the highest prevalence of FGM victims at 98% (UNFPA, 2019). Although it is often confined to a few countries, migration flows have removed the boundaries of FGM presence and brought the practice and its effects around the world. In the United States, an estimated 513,000 women are either at risk or have been subjected to FGM (Goldberg et al., 2016). Although these estimates were published in 2016, the data used in the analysis is from 2012. Thus, we are interested in updating the estimates of FGM in the United States.

These data are from American Community Survey (ACS), a survey conducted by the US census. From this data source, we extracted estimates of the place of birth of men and women in the United States. The place of birth includes both US states and countries outside of the US. ACS provides yearly estimates, but we chose a 5-year estimate from 2018 because these data have the largest sample size and the data is collected for all areas in the US, despite population size. Thus, we thought these data would give us the most accurate estimates of US women's place of birth. 

We obtained these data from UNICEF, who compiled the prevalence of FGM in countries. They used data sources such as DHS, MICS, EDSF, which are large-scale population based global surveys. The dates for these population surveys range from 2004 to 2018. These are the most validated and updated estimates of FGM available. 


To obtain the estimate the number of women living in the US who had experienced FGM, we created a new variable that was the multiplication of the country FGM estimate and the number of women born in that country, living in the US.
